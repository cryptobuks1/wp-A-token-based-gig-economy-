## "You can't help those who want to be homeless, like most of those down on that street."
Denver Resident

## Overview
Many people tend to believe that homeless people are lazy, drug addicted, and make the choice to be unemployed. These stereotypes occasionally hold merit, but can often be untrue. Research shows that the majority of homeless people actually have a desire to work and are actively pursuing work opportunities or already work one or more jobs.

Someone facing homelessness experiences a number of challenges that prevent them from transitioning to a more stable life. Without a bank account or a permanent address, the options for saving money and getting a legitimate job are drastically reduced. When your entire life is in a grocery cart and you face the risk of theft from other homeless, getting back on your feet can seem impossible. These hurdles are just part of what contributes to the vicious cycle of __chronic homelessness.__

## Problem

- Vulnerable to wage theft
- No physical permanent address for bank applications, rent applications or job prospects
- No identification or proof of social security number
- Mental or behavioral disorders
- Learned helplessness theory
- No way to save or store assets
- Existing outside of society

## Solution

#### RESEARCH

**7** | **2** | **3** | **3** | **3** | **100**
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Nonprofit interviews | Survey Collections | Blockchain Conferences | Case Studies | City Council Meetings | Hours of research

#### THEORY
- Give the homeless population empowerment and self reliance through an accessible tokenized economy.
- Adapt a "home-first" approach coupled with the appropriate mental, medical and social support needed.
- Learn from those in the community who are already successful
- Build a platform that allows everyone to succeed.


#### IDEA
- Build a tokenized gig economy for the homeless that provide them with a method of identification.
- Create a crypto wallet to store assets that can not be converted into cash with restrictions similar to SNAP but with more buying potential.
- Enable users to create a work history.
- Use blockchain to prevent wage theft.
- Engage with the local community and government to change the perceptions of the homeless
