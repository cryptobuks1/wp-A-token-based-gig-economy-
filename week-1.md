# Week 1 Deliverables
## Why is blockchain needed to solve this problem?
Today across the country our cities are suffering from a growing homeless problem. Attempts to address the problem only seem to proliferate the issue. San Francisco is in the midst of a homeless crisis, throwing $30Million at the problem only to find homelessness increase by 17%. 

The problem is not lack of funding, but lack of human understanding. Issues facing people on street only perpetuate their homeless state. These issues are:

- No form of identification
- No bank account
- No acccessible labor market
- Vulnerable to wage theft
- Learned helplessness (dejected from society)
- No civic engagement or social capital

## What demographics do you serve? What is the size of the market?


## What other solutions are currently being used to afdress this problem? (other companies, workarounds, systems or procersses that can complete with or substitute your product)



## What are the geopolitical, cultural-social-economic factors that must be taken into consideration? What are some nuances and complexities that must be addressed?
We are moving government funding away from current infrastructures that are not working to Wolf Pack instead. There could be some backlash from shelters and other non-profits that rely on this funding to support their models. The cultural-social-economic factors that are important to consider are the current feelings and attitudes towards unhomed individuals. Community members see the homeless as unclean vermin and a nuisance and strain on tax dollars. The key component to Wolf Pack’s success is bridging the gap between these groups (employers, vendors and the homeless), and building civic engagement between all parties working towards a common goal. The homeless are seen as a risky, potentially volatile and addict population which means getting employers on-board as well as vendors could pose barriers for adoption and acceptance. Also, without out long term options for affordable housing the homeless crisis will remain an unsolvable problem, regardless of Wolf Pack’s success.
