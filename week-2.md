# Week 2 - Pain Points and User Story

## User Persona:
Joe is a 40 year old, disabled, american veteran. He is chronically homeless which means he does not have any stable housing source. Joe has a substance abuse problem and does not have a job, although he has looked for employment. Joe has been robbed within the past 3 months “because on the streets, every time you walk away from things you own but can’t carry with you, you know you may come back and find them gone”<a href= "https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-02-29/homeless-population-stolen-possessions-cleaning-sweep"><(LA Times)</a> and he has frequented the emergency room several times because he prefers a hospital bed to a shelter bed. 

## Pain Points
- Vulnerable to wage theft 
- No physical permanent address for bank applications, rent applications or job prospects
- No identification or proof of social security number
- Mental or behavioral disorders
- Learned helplessness theory
- No way to save or store assets
- Existing outside of society

## Value Proposition
- Build a tokenized gig economy for the homeless that provide them with a method of identification.
- Create a crypto wallet to store assets that can not be converted into cash with restrictions similar to SNAP but with more buying potential.
- Enable users to create a work history.
- Use blockchain to prevent wage theft.
- Build a positive reward system so that homeless individuals can work towards earning a beneficial reputation within their community.

## Distribution and go-to-market strategy. Partners?
- Learn from those in the community who are already successful
- Build a platform that allows everyone to succeed.
- Engage with the local community and government to change the perceptions of the homeless 


## Risks associated with WolfPack?
Money management within a crypto environment. Barriers to entry with technology. Speed of technology. Are the homeless willing to use the platform? Will vendors and employers feel secure working with homeless individuals and blockchain?


## Measurable impact of your solution.
Currently there is no return on investment for funds used for homeless initiatives. Our goal with Wolf Pack is to be able to show an increased employment rate, decrease in emergency room facilities used by the homeless and an increase in funds returned to the local economy by Wolf Pack users. We can also measure the number of transitional housing enrollments and graduates to more permanent housing and with the rewards system we can measure social capital and civic engagement.
